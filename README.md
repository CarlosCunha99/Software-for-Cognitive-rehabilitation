# Software-for-Cognitive-rehabilitation
The project aims to help everyone who's going through cognitive rehabilitation using serious games to exercise the brain and trackers that help the healthcare professional, associated with the patient, evaluate the progress and adapt the treatment accordingly. There will also be available documentation regarding mental health for anyone whoâ€™s interested.
               Serious games were chosen for this project due to their ability to entertain and exercise the brain making the process of rehabilitation feel less like a treatment and more like a hobby. Doing so is expected that the patients obtain better results and participate more willingly.
               As discussed above, the patient will be associated with a healthcare expert, but also, the recovery subject will have a family member associated. This will provide the health worker a responsible contact in case the patient has a decline in his thinking skills and cognitive abilities.
